Proof of concept for html generation. Please do not use this for actual projects

This was created in an attempt to efficiently procrastinate. The idea was to mimick a website exactly: laucparis.com. As I was rather lazy, I more or less copied the html of said website. If you have a keen eye, you can even spot some artifacts.
